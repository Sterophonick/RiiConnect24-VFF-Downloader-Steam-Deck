# VFF-file-Downloader-Dolphin-Linux
Downloads the RiiConnect24 .VFF files necessary for the Forecast and News Channel to work in Dolphin on Linux

RiiConnect24 has their own script to do this but it is Windows only so I wrote one for Linux.

To use run config.sh and answer the questions and then run wc24.sh to download the files. I haven't made it update regularly yet so to do that you'll have to set it up with cron or something. Otherwise every time you want updated News and Weather you'll have to run wc24.sh again

Sorry this isn't the best readme. This is the first time I've ever made anything like this that I put online for others to use.
