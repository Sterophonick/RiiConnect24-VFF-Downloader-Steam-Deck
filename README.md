# VFF-file-Downloader-Dolphin-Steam-Deck
Modification of my original scripts to download the VFF files for Linux but changed to point to the flatpak directory for the Steam Deck.

This only allows the News and Weather channels to work. You need to run the RiiConnect24 Patcher to download the WAD for the Check Mii Out Channel.

## Usage

Run setup.sh and then run wc24.sh

Does not automatically update so you have to run it every time you want updated news and weather.
Here's some modifications to scripts  I wrote to do this on Linux before Riiconnect24 had Dolphin linux support.
