# Steam Deck RiiConnect24 VFF Downloader
Modification of some old scripts I wrote for myself before RiiConnect24 officially added support for Dolphin on Linux but changed to point to the flatpak directory for Dolphin for the Steam Deck.

I have no affiliation with the RiiConnect24 team in any way. If you have an issue that isn't related to this script I can't help.

This only allows the News and Weather channels to work. You need to run the RiiConnect24 Patcher to download the WAD for the Check Mii Out Channel. The patcher also doesn't work on the Steam Deck unless you disable read only on the rootfs so you can install xdelta3 through pacman so just run it on something else and copy the WAD to your steam deck if you want the Check Mii Out Channel to work. Because copyright exists I can't give you download links to them :(

## Usage

Run setup.sh and then run rc24

Does not automatically update so you have to run rc24 every time you want updated news and weather.
