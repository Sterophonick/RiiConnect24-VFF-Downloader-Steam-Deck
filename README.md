# VFF-file-Downloader-Dolphin-Steam-Deck
Modification of my original scripts to download the VFF files for Linux but changed to point to the flatpak directory for the Steam Deck.

## Usage

Run setup.sh and then run wc24.sh

Does not automatically update so you have to run it every time you want updated news and weather.
